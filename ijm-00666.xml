             <p>How does the structure of an economic system affect its performance? By
                &#x2018;structure&#x2019; we mean the way in which different constituent parts are
                related to each other in terms of communication and decision-making. Most economies
                have a complex mix of different structures including markets, firms, and government
                agencies of various kinds. Despite their differences, all these structures face the
                common problem of coordinating the activities of constituent parts who possess
                private information. There are two ways in which markets, firms, and government
                agencies solve coordination problems: centralization and decentralization. The
                Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a central clearing house and quotation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Millo et al., 2005</xref>), but Torino&#x2019;s
                farmers market has no such central structure. Alfred Sloan granted considerable
                autonomy to division managers in General Motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sloan, 1964</xref>), but such autonomy does not exist in all firms 
                 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Love et al., 2002</xref>). The United States
                government consists of various federal, state, and local departments with
                overlapping jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liesbet and Gary, 2003</xref>). The North Korean government is presumably largely centrally
                organized with organs like the &#x2018;Central People&#x2019;s Committee&#x2019; and
                the &#x2018;State Planning Committee&#x2019;. As to how the structure of an economic
                system affects its performance is a fundamental theoretical question with a bearing
                on the microstructure of markets, the internal organization of firms, and the
                structure of governments.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we compare the performance of a centralized and a decentralized system
                in solving a simple coordination problem when their constituent parts make errors in
                communicating private information. We find that the decentralized system is more
                robust than the centralized system to communication errors. But the centralized
                system takes less time than the decentralized system to create coordination. Our
                analysis sheds light on the influence of communication technology on organizational
                forms, the greater variability of autocratic societies compared to democratic
                societies, the variation in economic organization with product type, and the
                preference for centralized organization in urgencies like war.</p>
            <p>We study a simple ordering problem in which agents are indexed by a number and
                randomly placed on a line. The coordination problem is to order the agents according
                to their numbers, with the least numbered agent on left and highest numbered on the
                right. In the centralized system, agents communicate their numbers to a central
                authority, who uses the information to order the agents. In the decentralized
                system, agents communicate their numbers to neighbours and swap positions if the
                number of the agent on left is more than the number of the agent on right. Agents
                probabilistically make errors in communicating private information in the
                centralized system and the decentralized system. We find that the decentralized
                system is more robust to communication errors than the centralized system. This is
                because the centralized system of coordination involves a strong-dependence between
                the information communicated by constituent parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Simon, 1962</xref>). Errors in the information communicated by one agent to the
                central-coordinator negatively affects the usefulness of the information
                communicated by other agents to the central-coordinator. The decentralized system on
                the other hand involves weak-dependence between the information communicated by
                constituent parts. Errors in the information communicated by one agent to its
                neighbour has a negligible effect on the usefulness of the information communicated
                by other agents to their neighbours. The localization of decision-making in the
                decentralized system limits the impact of communication errors on the
                system&#x2019;s performance. The strong-dependence between the information
                communicated by different agents in the centralized system and the weak-dependence
                in the decentralized system is a consequence of the difference in structure of
                communication and decision-making in the two systems.</p>

            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">von Neumann, 1951</xref> illustrates the idea of
                strong-dependence and weak-dependence with the following analogy. Imagine placing
                your hand in a tub of water at 80&#x00B0;C. There are two ways to communicate this
                information from the nerve endings in your hand to your brain. One way is to convey
                the temperature in binary form. Another way is the counting method, where one count
                is communicated for each 1&#x00B0;C. Interestingly, the human nervous system uses a
                mechanism roughly akin to the counting method. This despite the fact that the
                counting method involves communicating orders of magnitude more information than the
                binary method. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">von Neumann, 1951</xref>, p. 101)
                speculates on why the human nervous system uses the counting method: &#x201C;...the
                counting method has a high stability and safety from error. If you express a number
                of the order of million by counting and miss a count, the result is only
                irrelevantly changed. If you express it by (decimal or binary) expansion, a single
                error in a single digit may vitiate the entire result.&#x2019;</p>

                conveyed by all other digits is vitiated by a single error. In contrast to the

                of strong and weak dependence are at play in centralized and decentralized systems,
                and is the cause of the greater robustness of the decentralized system to

            <p>Though the decentralized system is more robust to communication errors, the
                centralized system uses less time to create coordination. The absence of a central
                decision-making unit means that the decentralized system has to muddle through
                numerous local communications and decisions, all of which takes time. The very
                structural feature that makes the decentralized system robust also makes it slow.
                Centralization is preferable to decentralization when there is urgency and when
                constituent parts are less likely to make errors in communicating private
                information.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></p>

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Peters, 1998</xref>). The literature on the
                architecture of economic systems began with the socialist calculation debate between
                Otto Neurath and Ludwig von Mises, though the modern strand originates from the
                contributions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayek, 1945</xref> claimed the
                market system is superior to communist central planning in using dispersed
                information to coordinate the activities of different agents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lange, 1936</xref> argued central planning can attain efficient
                allocation of resources by mimicking the price system. While the relative advantages
                of price, shadow-price, and non-price mechanisms of coordination are important,
                &#x2018;there is more at stake in the choice of an economic system&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sah and Stiglitz, 1986</xref>), p. 726). One of the
                differences between centralized and decentralized economic systems is how they
                perform in the presence of communication errors. The difference between the Soviet
                centrally planned economy and the US economy is not only one of the extent to which
                they use price signals to communicate economic information, but also the structures
                through which they communicate information. These structures influence the
                performance of the two systems when economic signals contain noise.</p>
            <p>The question of the architecture of economic systems is not limited to understanding
                the differences between economic systems. It also pertains to understanding the
                differences in the mix of markets, firms, and government agencies within an economic
                system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>). Our paper
                is a close cousin of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sah and Stiglitz, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolton and Farrell, 1990</xref>, and
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guerini et al., 2016</xref>. While we study
                the consequence of errors in the communication of information, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sah and Stiglitz, 1986</xref> study the consequence of errors in the
                processing of information in alternate economic arrangements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolton and Farrell, 1990</xref> study the problem of entry in a
                system with two agents with differing costs. Bolton and Farrell argue that
                decentralization involves duplication and delay. We too find decentralization
                involves delay, but for a reason different from Bolton and Farrell&#x2019;s. In our
                model, the decentralized system takes more time than the centralized system because
                the decentralized system has to muddle through numerous local communications and
                decision-making. In Bolton and Farrell&#x2019;s model, delay occurs because agents
                do not communicate with each other in the decentralized system. <xref

                performance of a centralized and a decentralized protocol of search and matching.
                They find that the centralized protocol produces full-employment, whereas the
                decentralized protocol produces unemployment. We believe their results may change if
                the coordinator in the centralized protocol has to collect private information from
                agents who make communication errors.</p>
            <p>In the literature on the role of information in shaping the internal organization of

                ingredients with these papers, while differing from them in important respects. In
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stein, 2002</xref> model agents do not
                communicate private information in the decentralized system. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acemoglu et al. (2007)</xref> model agents do not
                communicate private information in the centralized system. In contrast to Stein and
                Acemoglu et al., we study the differences in the performance of centralized and
                decentralized systems due to the differences in their structures of communication
                and decision-making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Maskin et al., 2000</xref>
                and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso et al., 2008</xref> study the
                differences in performances of systems because their structure influences the
                incentives to communicate private information. Our paper studies the differences in
                performance of systems even when their structures do not influence incentives.
                Matters other than incentives matter. All this means that even when our conclusions
                concur with those of other papers in the literature, the reasoning behind the
                conclusions differ. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stein, 2002</xref> concludes decentralization is preferable when information is
                difficult to communicate. This is similar to our conclusion that decentralization is
                preferable when there is a greater likelihood of communication errors. After all,
                information is difficult to communicate when there are communication errors.
                However, the reasoning behind Stein&#x2019;s conclusion differs from ours. In
                Stein&#x2019;s case, decentralization is preferable when information is difficult to
                communicate because no communication is necessary in the decentralized system. In
                our case, decentralization is preferable when information is difficult to
                communicate because the localization of communication limits the consequences of
                communication errors on the system&#x2019;s performance. Our contribution to the
                literature on firms is that the internal structure of firms matters because it
                determines the robustness of firms to employees&#x2019; communication errors and the
                speed with which firms can coordinate the activities of its employees.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ostrom et al., 1961</xref> argue that the presence of multiple government agencies with
                    overlapping jurisdictions is not a pathological phenomenon, nor can the problems
                    posed by the multiplicity of government agencies be resolved by centralization. The
                    contribution by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ostrom et al., 1961</xref> sparked
                    an interesting literature on the origin and performance of alternate structures of
                    government. This literature studied a variety of ways in which structure affects
                    performance, including the relation between norms and governance structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ostrom, 1999</xref>), and the influence of
                    government structure on incentives to truthfully reveal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendor et al., 2001</xref>). Our analysis suggests
                    that the structure of government influences performance, even when the structure
                    does not influence social norms and incentives. Most governments have a rich and
                    intricate framework for negotiation and adjudication between different agencies.
                    Negotiation and adjudication involves error-prone communication. Our model suggests
                    that the structure of government influences its robustness to error-prone
                    communication between different agencies and the speed with which governments can
                    execute tasks. Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model.

            <title>The model</title>
            <p>Imagine a set of <italic>n</italic> agents numbered from 1 to <italic>n</italic>. No
                two agents have the same number. The agents are randomly placed on a line segment;
                they are in no particular order. The coordination problem is to order the agents
                from 1 to <italic>n</italic> from left to right, where each agent&#x2019;s number is
                one greater than the number of its neighbour on the left and one less than the
                number of its neighbour on the right. The first agent does not have a left neighbour
                and the last agent does not have a right neighbour.</p>
            <p>There are two ways to order the agents: a centralized system and a decentralized
                system. In the centralized system, each agent conveys its number to a
                central-coordinator. The central-coordinator orders the agents on a line segment.
                For instance, if an agent communicates its number as 3, the central-coordinator
                places the agent in position 3 on the line segment. The central-coordinator orders
                the agents as the agents communicate their numbers to the central-coordinator.</p>
            <p>The decentralized system works differently. Each time step, pairs of neighbouring
                agents are randomly selected. Within each pair, agents share information about each
                other&#x2019;s numbers. If the agent on the left reports a number greater than the
                agent on the right, the agents swap positions, otherwise the agents remain in their
                current positions. Over time, the agents incrementally order themselves.</p>
            <p>Agents make errors in communicating their numbers, i.e. with some probability an
                agent conveys an incorrect number. When an agent makes a communication error, it
                reports a random number between 1 and <italic>n</italic> rather than its true
                number. Communication errors create problems in the centralized system and the
                decentralized system. In the centralized system, the central-coordinator places the
                agent who reports an incorrect number in an incorrect location. Further problems
                arise because another agent cannot be placed in that location. For instance, if
                <italic>agent 3</italic> reports number 5 and is placed in location 5,
                <italic>agent 5</italic> cannot be placed in location 5. When an agent reports a
                number whose location is occupied, the central-coordinator places it in the nearest
                empty location.</p>
            <p>In the decentralized system, communication errors cause agents to wrongly swap
                positions, i.e. a greater number agent may move left and a lower number agent may

                neighbours with <italic>agent 3</italic> on the left of <italic>agent 5</italic>.
                Upon activation the agents communicate their numbers to each other. <italic>Agent
                    3</italic> correctly communicates its number, but <italic>agent 5</italic> makes
                an error and communicates 2 as its number. The two agents swap positions.
                <italic>Agent 5</italic> moves left and <italic>agent 3</italic> moves right,
                thereby decreasing the system&#x2019;s coordination.</p>
            <p>In the centralized system, at the first time step all <italic>n</italic> agents
                communicate their numbers to the central-coordinator. The central-coordinator orders
                the agents at the end of the first time step using the collected information. In the
                decentralized system, at each time step, <italic>n</italic> neighbouring pairs of
                agents are randomly activated. The activated agents exchange information and swap
                positions if necessary. In the decentralized system, agents incrementally order
                themselves over many time steps.</p>

                and the numbers of their respective locations. For instance, if <italic>agent
                    3</italic> is at location 5, the absolute value of difference is 2. The sum of
                these differences is divided by the total number of agents and multiplied by
                negative one to measure coordination. Zero indicates perfect coordination, lower

            <p>Section three reports the results from numerous simulations of the model. In each
                simulation, the centralized system is run for one time step because it orders the
                agents after the first time step. In each simulation, the decentralized system is
                run for 1000 time steps, and its coordination is measured at the end of the last
                time step. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig"

                    <p>Note: In the centralized system, each agent conveys its number to a

                        segment. In the decentralized system, at each time step, pairs of
                        neighbouring agents are randomly selected. Within each pair, agents share
                        information about each other&#x2019;s numbers. If the agent on the left
                        reports a number greater than the agent on the right, the agents swap
                        positions, otherwise the agents remain in their present positions. Agents
                        make errors in communicating their numbers, i.e. with some probability an
                        agent conveys an incorrect number. Coordination is the negative mean of the
                        absolute value of the differences between the numbers of agents and the
                        numbers of their respective locations. The sum of these differences is
                        divided by the total number of agents and multiplied by negative one to
                        measure coordination. Zero indicates perfect coordination, lower values of C
                        indicate lesser coordination.</p>

                        <p>Here is an example of a list with multiple paragraphs and equations.</p>
                       <p>A discrete three-dimensional model space was generated, with dimensions
                            corresponding to population &#x00B5;, population &#x03C3;, and f value.
                            Any given value in the matrix indicates P(f|&#x03BC;,&#x03C3;),
                            that&#x00A0;is, the probability of a given frequency given a particular
                            &#x03BC; and &#x03C3;. The columns (all f values for a given &#x03BC;
                            and &#x03C3; combination) thus constitute
                            the forward model (by which stimuli are generated), and the planes (all
                            combinations of &#x03BC; and &#x03C3; for a given f value) constitute the inverse model (by which
                            hidden parameters can be estimated from observed f values).</p>
                    </list-item>
                     <list-item>
                        <p> 2) For each segment, the model was inverted for its particular f value,
                            yielding a two-dimensional probability distribution for the hidden
                            parameters. Steps 3-6 were then worked
                            through for each stimulus segment in order, starting at the beginning of
                            the stimulus.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>These probability distributions, for each segment subsequent to the most
                            recent estimated population change (as defined later), were multiplied
                            together, and scaled to a sum of 1. The resulting probability
                            distribution) thus reflects parameter
                            probabilities taking into account all relevant f values</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>This combined parameter probability distribution was then scalar
                            multiplied with the full model space, in order to weight each of the
                            forward model columns (each corresponding to a particular parameter
                            combination) by the probability of that parameter combination being in
                            effect. The resulting weighted model space was then averaged across
                            parameter dimensions, to yield a one-dimensional (forward) probability
                            distribution, constituting an optimal prediction about the f value of
                            the next stimulus segment, provided a population change did not occur
                            before then. A probability distribution applicable if a population
                            change were to occur was calculated the same way, but without weighting
                            the forward model columns (so as to encompass every possible parameter
                            combination).</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>It was assumed that a population change occurred immediately prior to the
                            first stimulus segment. To infer subsequent population changes, for each
                            segment the probability of observing the present f value was compared
                            for the two probability distributions (the distribution assuming a
                            population change, and the distribution assuming no change),
                            that&#x00A0;is, P(f|c) and P(f|&#x007E;c), respectively, with c denoting
                            a population change. The probabilities were compared, in conjunction
                            with the known prior probability of a population change (1/8), using
                            Bayes&#x2019; rule, as stated in Equation 2:<disp-formula id="equ3"

                        <p>Here, P(c|f) is the chance that a population change occurred at that
                            particular time. Given that P(c) is known to be 1/8, and P(f), the total
                            probability of the observed f value, can be rewritten
                            P(f|c)P(c)+P(f|&#x007E;c)(1-P(c)), the above equation can be rewritten

                        <p>For each segment, the above calculation of P(c|f) was made not only with
                            respect to the immediately preceding segment, but also a number of
                            segments preceding that, up to a maximum of 4. Therefore, for segment t,
                            it was possible to conclude that a population change had occurred
                            immediately prior to t, t-1, t-2, t-3, or none of the above. A
                            population change was judged to have occurred at the time point with the
                            highest value of P(c|f), provided this value was greater than 0.5. Using
                            more than 4 lags did not appreciably alter the estimates obtained by
                            model inversion. Importantly, any retrospective inference of population
                            changes did not retrospectively alter any prior predictions generated by
                            the model (e.g. at time t, if a population change were inferred to have
                            occurred at time t-3 then the priors for t-2, t-1 and t were not
                            affected, but only the priors for t+1 onwards).</p>

                        <p>Once the above steps were worked through for each stimulus segment in
                            order, the optimal prior predictions were used to calculate the
                            perceptual inference variables of interest. Predictions themselves were
                            summarised by their mean (&#x03BC;) and precision (1/variance). Changes
                            to predictions (&#x0394;&#x00B5;) were calculated as the absolute change
                            (in octaves) in &#x03BC; from one prediction to the next. Surprise (S)
                            was calculated as the negative log probability of the observed f value
                            given the prior prediction, and prediction error (irrespective of
                            prediction precision) was calculated as the absolute difference (in
                            octaves) between the observed f value and the mean of the prior
                            prediction. Mathematically, surprise is directly proportional to
                            prediction precision multiplied by prediction error. Finally, &#x0394;f
                            was calculated as the absolute difference between the current and
                            preceding value of f.</p>

                        We propose a Bayesian scheme for BCV (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">equation 2</xref>) that accommodates the influence of context on incentive value. BCV focuses on scenarios (i) where incentive value depends 
                        on contextual information (either represented by cues or by previous rewards) provided before options or rewards are presented, and (ii) where reward is defined 
                        by a single attribute (e.g., reward amount). To describe the basic principles of BCV, we adopt the formalism of Bayesian graphs where a generative model is 
                        described by nodes or circles, representing random variables (shaded and white circles refer to observed and non-observed variables respectively), 
                        and arrows, representing causal relationships among variables. A simple generative model hypothesized by BCV is shown in
                        Figure 1A of another article (not linked here), where C represents prior beliefs about the average reward expected in a given context. 
                        Formally, this corresponds to a (Gaussian) prior belief (with mean

        <p>eLife is tagged up as XML using the NISO standard JATS DTD.
            We conform to the JATS4R recommendations where possible and also deliver our content to PMC.
            We also convert our JATS XML to PubMed and CrossRef DTDs when we deposit our content with them.
            eLife content is delivered to more repositories and it can be scraped from the eLife site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Love et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ostrom, 1999</xref>;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sloan, 1964</xref>).</p>
        <p>The following is an example of monotype text within the body of an eLife article.</p>
        <p><monospace>P<sub>NRE+AP-1</sub>: 5’– CTTCGTGACTAGTCTTGACTCAGA –3’</monospace></p>
        <p><monospace>P<sub>RAM</sub>: 5’– CTAGAAGTTTGTTCGTGACTCAGA –3’</monospace></p>

        <p>In some cases, authors will include extremely long gene sequences or other letter strings that need to be enclosed withing a particular style tagging in order that
        they can be wrapped on the final HTML display. If this tagging is not included, the strings will likely spill across the edge of the text column, which can look very
        messy, not to mention rather silly: <named-content content-type="sequence">TAATAAGGAAGAACTGCTTATTCTTAATTATTTCTACCTACTAAACTAACTAATTATCAACAAATATCATCTATTTAATAGTATATCATCACATGCGGTGTAAGAGGATGACATAAAGATTGAGAAACAGTCATCCAGTCTAATGGAAGCTCAAATGCAAGGGCTGATAATGTAATAGGATAATGAATGACAACGTATAAAAGGAAAGAAGATAAAGCAATATTATTTTGTAGAATTATCGATTCCCTTTTGTGGATCCCTATATCCTCGAGGAGAA</named-content>.
        Sequences like this should be tagged during pre-editing. This tagging will also increase discoverability of gene sequences in
        eLife articles.</p>
